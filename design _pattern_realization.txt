Design Pattern Realization text file documentation:

1. Singleton Pattern:
   - Where it's used: In the DatabaseConnection class, we ensure only one instance of the connection is created.
   - Description: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful in cases where a single object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

2. Factory Method:
   - Where it's used: In the VehicleFactory class, where different types of vehicles (Car, Bike) are created based on the provided input.
   - Description: The Factory Method defines an interface for creating objects, but it’s the responsibility of the subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.

3. Observer Pattern:
   - Where it's used: In the StockPriceMonitor class, where multiple subscribers are notified when stock prices change.
   - Description: The Observer pattern is used when one object (subject) needs to notify multiple dependent objects (observers) about changes in its state without knowing who or what those objects are.

4. Strategy Pattern:
   - Where it's used: In the PaymentProcessing class, which can select a payment method (CreditCard, PayPal) at runtime.
   - Description: The Strategy pattern is used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. The client can choose the appropriate algorithm at runtime.

5. Decorator Pattern:
   - Where it's used: In the NotificationService class, where different notification types (SMS, Email) are dynamically added to the base notification service.
   - Description: The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to individual objects, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.


Code Inspection: They will need to thoroughly inspect the repository to spot instances where design patterns are being applied.
Class and Method Analysis: They should analyze class responsibilities, object creation methods, and communication between objects.
Pattern Matching: Compare identified structures with common design patterns they’ve studied.
Final Documentation: They will finalize their findings and write the design patterns in the required text file.
This process not only helps them learn how design patterns are implemented but also deepens their understanding of how these patterns make code more efficient, reusable, and maintainable.
